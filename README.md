# Resistance Color and Value Calculator App

### Features

This app has two main features associated with it. 
The first is that you can take the colors of the bands on a resistor and find the resistance of it.
The second is that you can enter a resistance and find what the resistor should look like.
This will work for four, five, and six band resistors. 
It can also work with three band resistor since the fourth band is tolerance and when "None" is selected its value is 20% which is the same for all three band resistors.

This app also has a few extra small features associated with it. The user can share their resistor values (or copy) and send to someone or themselves. The user can also 
send feedback directly to my email that I had setup for this. The main thing is that they can popup a window that displays a chart to show what each color on the 
specific bands represent and their numerical values associated with it.
