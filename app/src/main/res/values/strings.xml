        This app has can find the resistance of three types of resistors; four, five, and six
        banded resistors. The idea is that you will look at the colors of the bands on the resistor
        then, plug them into the dropdowns, and then the resistance and other information will be
        displayed on screen.\nYou can also look at the charts for each type of resistor
        for convince.
